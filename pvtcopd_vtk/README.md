The folder should contain the raw point clouds of the 10 cases of the PVT1010 dataset that coincide with DIRLAB-COPDgene and can be used for testing of our model. 
Please download the .vtk files and cite the original NeurIPS paper as detailed in the data access for the full 1010 point clouds.

The vascular tree reconstructions that are used in this study were part of the COPDGene study (NCT00608764). This study has been IRB approved and participants have provided their consent.

In addition you need to include the txt-files from DIRLAB-COPDgene that comprise 300 landmark pairs each for evaluating the target registration error. To obtain these and the full (imaging) data please refer to https://med.emory.edu/departments/radiation-oncology/research-laboratories/deformable-image-registration/downloads-and-reference-data/copdgene.html
