Code, models and dataset for ICCV 2023 (oral) paper on differentiable volumetric rasterisation of point clouds for 3D registration

Trained models can be found in the subdirectory models, inference and evaluation code for the geometric networks is already available. Instance optimisation and training of models will follow soon (at latest in time for ICCV in October 2023).

The newly created LCSD500 dataset is available for download at https://cloud.imi.uni-luebeck.de/s/mtPmXoeNrnntNBg (170MB).
